Had a meeting. Present at the meeting was Andrew, Kim, Maggie and Emily.

Emily told us that the doubling of the medication may initially have an adverse
effect on Noah, where it increases his clarity and motivation without improving
his mood.

They said that could visit at 10:00 am on Monday, 31st March.

Kim spoke to Emily twice, in the morning and the afternoon. 

In the morning Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped eating.

In the afternoon Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped talking
to his brother.
  
Emily supported that the Noah visitation needed to be brought forward
to be earlier then Monday 31st March.

Emily said she would call at 8:00 am on Tuesday morning.

We were expecting a call at 8:00 am from Emily at CYMH. She did not call. 
Kim called at 8:30 and spoke to Maggie. Emily apparently had a flat tire.

Kim described the matter as urgent, stating how important it was that Noah was visited before Monday.
Maggie said that she would talk to her team leader.

In a subsequent conversation after Kim called her back, Maggie said that it would be discussed 
on Wednesday morning with the team, and she would call on Wednesday afternoon to let Kim know
if it was possible for a team to meet Noah earlier than Monday 31th.

Kim got upset, and asked Maggie what she would do. 
Maggie said sometime people have to go through horrible experiences like the hospital before they can accept the consequences and get help.
