Received an email from Justin Williams.

    Hi Kim,

    I am very sorry for the delay in getting back to you. This is just to acknowledge your e-mail. 
    I will talk to the Young Adult team tomorrow and either I or another member of the team will 
    get back to you.

    Best wishes

**Monday 10/3/2025**

We were going to have a meeting, but it was rescheduled.


**Thursday 20/03/2025**

Had a meeting. Present at the meeting was Andrew, Kim, Maggie and Emily.

Emily told us that the doubling of the medication may initially have an adverse
effect on Noah, where it increases his clarity and motivation without improving
his mood.

They said that could visit at 10:00 am on Monday, 31st March.

**Monday 24/03/2025**

Kim spoke to Emily twice, in the morning and the afternoon. 

In the morning Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped eating.

In the afternoon Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped talking
to his brother.
  
Emily supported that the Noah visitation needed to be brought forward
to be earlier then Monday 31st March.

Emily said she would call at 8:00 am on Tuesday morning.

**Tuesday 25/03/2025**

We were expecting a call at 8:00 am from Emily at CYMH. She did not call. 
Kim called at 8:30 and spoke to Maggie. Emily apparently had a flat tire.

Kim described the matter as urgent, stating how important it was that Noah was visited before Monday.
Maggie said that she would talk to her team leader.

In a subsequent conversation after Kim called her back, Maggie said that it would be discussed 
on Wednesday morning with the team, and she would call on Wednesday afternoon to let Kim know
if it was possible for a team to meet Noah earlier than Monday 31th.

Kim got upset, and asked Maggie what she would do. 
Maggie said sometime people have to go through horrible experiences like the hospital before they can accept the consequences and get help.

At **3:45** Maggie called Kim and asked to speak to Noah. Noah refused to talk to Maggie.

Kim asked questions to Maggie about calling 000. Maggie suggested he call 000 if he communicated an immediate risk.
What are the chances of the home visit.

IF we called 000 he would end up in accident emergency and be triaged. If it wasn't a physical risk he would be moved to Wattle.


Maggie is off on training on Wednesday. There will be discussion tomorrow. They want the home visit to be after the medication takes effect.
She has asked Emily to call us tomorrow.

Hermann's office is just across the road from Coles. We have an appointment for 10:00 am.

**Wednesday 26/03/2025**

First thing in the morning Kim sent an email to update Emily, and request a home visit.

Around 1:30 - 2:00 PM Dr Emily and a new person called Julie telephoned Kim.
They emailed a plan for Kim to share with Noah. `Engaging with your team <./engaging%20with%20your%20team.docx>`_



They said they will call the next day (Thursday) and on Friday to check in and confirm a time 
for a Friday visit. If everything is improved then they will keep their Monday appointment.
They will not give a time for the Friday visit. They could not give a time, other than "It won't be before 1:00".
They said that even though they could come, it could not be regular.

**Thursday 27/03/2025**

Dr Emily called but missed Kim and Kim returned the call. Dr Emily asked if we had shared the document with Noah and Kim said that she did not want to as it was not 
appropriate for his age or intellectual level. (It was too infantalising). Dr Emily said thank you 
for your feedback. Emily asked if we still wanted her to come tomorrow afternoon.
Kim said that it was likely that Noah would be hospitalised today. 
Kim asked to speak to Ashleigh. (The client liason person who we originally deal with) 
Dr Emily did not now who Ashleigh was.


In another call, Kim spoke to Madeline, the current team leader. 
She advised that Flora would be the person managing Noah.
(We were not happy with that.)
