**Thursday 30/1/2025**

Noah is taken from Southport Universtiy Hospital
to Wattyl.

**Thursday 6/2/2025**

Noah is discharged from Wattyl.

We were told that he was in the hands of the continuing care team.


**This crazy limbo period between then**

They called Noah and asked for consent.

**Friday 21/2/2025**

Kim sends an email to Justin Williams.

It has now been 16 days since Noah left the ward and no member of a Continuing Care team has sighted or spoken to him.

**Sometime Before Thursday 27/2/2025**

Kim spoke to her GP, and he made an urgent request to CHYMS.


**Thursday 27/2/2025**

Emily and Maggie vist Noah. The meeting lasts for 20 minutes.

At the end of the meeting, Emily and Maggie spoke to Kim for an hour.

**Monday 3/3/2025**

Received an email from Justin Williams.

    Hi Kim,

    I am very sorry for the delay in getting back to you. This is just to acknowledge your e-mail. 
    I will talk to the Young Adult team tomorrow and either I or another member of the team will 
    get back to you.

    Best wishes
 
    Justin

**Monday 10/3/2025**

We were going to have a meeting, but it was rescheduled.


**Thursday 20/03/2025**

Had a meeting. Present at the meeting was Andrew, Kim, Maggie and Emily.

Emily told us that the doubling of the medication may initially have an adverse
effect on Noah, where it increases his clarity and motivation without improving
his mood.

They said that could visit at 10:00 am on Monday, 31st March.

**Monday 24/03/2025**

Kim spoke to Emily twice, in the morning and the afternoon. 

In the morning Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped eating.

In the afternoon Kim told Emily that Noah had stopped talking
to his brother.
  
Emily supported that the Noah visitation needed to be brought forward
to be earlier then Monday 31st March.

Emily said she would call at 8:00 am on Tuesday morning.

**Tuesday 25/03/2025**

We were expecting a call at 8:00 am from Emily at CYMH. She did not call. 
Kim called at 8:30 and spoke to Maggie. Emily apparently had a flat tire.

Kim described the matter as urgent, stating how important it was that Noah was visited before Monday.
Maggie said that she would talk to her team leader.

In a subsequent conversation after Kim called her back, Maggie said that it would be discussed 
on Wednesday morning with the team, and she would call on Wednesday afternoon to let Kim know
if it was possible for a team to meet Noah earlier than Monday 31th.

Kim got upset, and asked Maggie what she would do. 
Maggie said sometime people have to go through horrible experiences like the hospital before they can accept the consequences and get help.

At **3:45** Maggie called Kim and asked to speak to Noah. Noah refused to talk to Maggie.

Kim asked questions to Maggie about calling 000. Maggie suggested he call 000 if he communicated an immediate risk.
What are the chances of the home visit.

IF we called 000 he would end up in accident emergency and be triaged. If it wasn't a physical risk he would be moved to Wattle.


Maggie is off on training on Wednesday. There will be discussion tomorrow. They want the home visit to be after the medication takes effect.
She has asked Emily to call us tomorrow.

Hermann's office is just across the road from Coles. We have an appointment for 10:00 am.

**Wednesday 26/03/2025**

First thing in the morning Kim sent an email to update Emily, and request a home visit.

Around 1:30 - 2:00 PM Dr Emily and a new person called Julie telephoned Kim.
They emailed a plan for Kim to share with Noah. `Engaging with your team <./engaging%20with%20your%20team.docx>`_



They said they will call the next day (Thursday) and on Friday to check in and confirm a time 
for a Friday visit. If everything is improved then they will keep their Monday appointment.
They will not give a time for the Friday visit. They could not give a time, other than "It won't be before 1:00".
They said that even though they could come, it could not be regular.

**Thursday 27/03/2025**

Dr Emily called but missed Kim and Kim returned the call. Dr Emily asked if we had shared the document with Noah and Kim said that she did not want to as it was not 
appropriate for his age or intellectual level. (It was too infantalising). Dr Emily said thank you 
for your feedback. Emily asked if we still wanted her to come tomorrow afternoon.
Kim said that it was likely that Noah would be hospitalised today. 
Kim asked to speak to Ashleigh. (The client liason person who we originally deal with) 
Dr Emily did not now who Ashleigh was.


In another call, Kim spoke to Madeline, the current team leader. 
She advised that Flora would be the person managing Noah.
(We were not happy with that.)

At **2:21** Madeline called back. Penny Larkin is the doctor.
We can be a "private patient" at Southport and have a different
psychiatrist. We could get an ambulance to take him to the
emergency department of a private hospital for medical help.
He would have to be a voluntary patient, rather than being
under the mental health care act. They will still check in
tomorrow morning.

Madeline said the restricted eating is symptomatic to the depressive
episode, not the other way round.

Kim dialed 000 and requested an ambulance to check on his physical health.

Two men came around, a Mental Health professional called Scott and a paramedic.
They did some basic tests on him and came to the conclusion that he was not
medically compromised and did not need to go to hospital. Scott also talked to
Noah for a while. Noah said things like "I'm out of hospital, I just want to do
my own thing, but they keep calling and texting me"

**Friday 28/03/2024**

In the morning Kim received a call from Dr Emily and Maggie to say that they
would no longer be visiting on this day (Friday) but on Monday instead.
The reason they gave was that, because he had been assessed by Scott and was
not considered to be medically compromised then the appointment would be 
better on Monday which was originally planned because at that point his medication
(which we were doubting he was actually taking) would be taking effect.
Kim got upset, saying that Scott had explicitly told Noah to expect them that day
and it would just further exacerbate his frustration and mistrust of the medical
establishment. 

After gathering her thoughts and discussing with her husband,
Kim called the office, wanting to talk to Belinda or the team leader, as she 
suspected that Dr Emily or Maggie did not have authority to make a new decision.
Kim was told that they had all ducked out of the office for twenty minutes.

In the afternoon Kim spoke to Amanda, the team leader. Apparently Belinda 
was in the room, but she did not say a word.
Amanda wanted to know the reason why Kim wanted to speak to her.
Kim told her story to Amanda. Amanda tried to argue that there was no
meeting scheduled for the Friday afternoon. 
Kim pointed out that Maggie, Madeline and Emily had all talked about
a Friday afternoon meeting. When confronted with what Scott said,
Amanada said she was not responsible for that paramedics say.
She did not answer the question.

Amanda said that AMIOS would not take them.
Kim said that AMIOS was discussed by Justin and Maggie.
She stressed that they made the decision to service him knowing full well
that he was unable to leave the house.
They would have known fully well what service

Kim said that she had always said that phones and letters
would not work.

Kim pointed out that there would be three more days of no eating.

Kim ended the meeting making it clear that this was not a compassionate
or logical decision based on the information she had.

**Mondey, 31st March 2025***

At **10:15** Belinda and Maggie visted at our home. Dr Emily was unable
to attend due to injuring herself on the weekend.

In the discussion prior to them attempting to talk to Noah,
we talked about the medication and his general state.

At **10::26** they went and knocked on Noah's bedroom door.

At **10:51** Noah had not let his room. Kim and Andrew asked them to come
downstairs and talk to us, but they just said they would really like to 
talk to Noah. Kim knocked on the door, and Noah yelled "Fuck Off" at the top
of his voice. The parents made it very clear that Noah was not going to leave
his room, but they remained outside his room anyway.

Belinda said that young people are very challenging. Not the first to barricade 
them in their room. Amios is the only outreach program in the private sector,
but for up to 18.

"Young Adult Services" is the service that said they could not act because
he is "not consenting".

He does not fit the CYMH model. They are trying to "adapt" their model to fit Noah.

Acknoweldged that Justin made some promises. 

They wanted to do a "capacity assessment" to see if he lacks capacity to go under the 
mental health act. She believes he has limited capacity and it would not be in his 
interest.

We asked them to justify why they decided not to come on Friday. If would require them to
shuffle appointments around on Friday. They were only going to cancel those appointments
if he was medically compromised. But because the ambulance said he was not medically
uncompromised, so they kept the other appointments.

Kim expressed he frustration about being shuffled from one department to another.

Belinda says she has special permission to keep Noah after he has turned 18.
It gets tricky with the consent thing, but she will be abe to give support to us.

Their model of service says they will do an initial outreach only.
It's a resource-intensive activity. They are will to try and do that.
They can't do it for six months.

They are happy to link us to private providers.

They are an acute short term service. 3 to 6 months top.
That's how it works in public mental health.

Kim talked about PDA and his need to independence. We currently put out food,
and it would be better if he got it himself. Do we stop enabling that?
Belinda did not have an answer, just reworded the dilemma. 

Talk about how NOah would have a perspective that's completely skewed, from being locked
away in the world.

Belinda said she's happy to try again and visit.

Talked about youth workers again. Would be nice if we got a young guy.

Actions from this meeting. They will discuss every case at their meeting on Wednesday
morning. Belinda chairs the meeting. They will do more outreach and link us with community 
service that can help. We need identity formation, individuation, build up his confidence.

Kim: we need a support worker. How qualified and experienced would this worker be.

Discussed Eden and how much we put on him. Belinda: he should just be a connection,
not a parent.

Belinda: with regards to hospital and getting treatment in an intensive way.
Robina Private would take him, but it has to be voluntary. He did see some benefit
that Wattyl got him talking to people again. There are other options, but they have 
to be voluntary and he cannot be medically compromised.

Talked about how Noah told Scott on Thursday how he thought that his record 
will be wiped when he turns 18. Somebody needs to explain to him that his
records are very private.

Belinda alerted us to potential conflict of interest because she works at Robina 
private working with out patients. Belinda would not be able to work with Noah
at Robina Private because of the conflict.

**Tuesday 8/04/2025**

Kim canclled the pending appointment at our house with Noah, because Noah is currently sleeping between 9am and 5 pm.

**Wednesday 9/04/2025**

Kim and Maggie talked on the phone. Kim reiterated that she did not think it was worth them coming:

- Noah was getting up at 5pm at that moment
- It was his 18th birthday the next day. He might see this as a last ditch effort to control him.

Maggie said that they were still willing to talk to Noah on the parent's consent even after Noah was 18.

Kim agreed that we still needed help, and suggested they talk again on Monday.
We talked about the messages that says "Please call to confirm if you are unable to attend."

Talked about the conversation with Amanda. Amanda does operational, Belinda does clinical.

Maggie says she will call at the end of the day and will schedule the next home visit.

**Monday 12/5/2025**

Meeting with Kim, Andrew and Belinda.

Question about keeping up the prescription. Belinda can give us a 6 month supply.
After that Noah needs a GP. It should not be a big deal - simply say that this is working
and he would like a new one.

20mg is the "therapeutic dose". We could up it for an anxiety dose.

We talk about his presentation.

- Stays in his room
- Comes out of his room if the parents are not at home. He will not occupy the same room as his parents. Comes downstairs
 to see Eden. 
- His hair is a frightful mess.
- Last night he shaved and brushed his teeth, and showers regularly.
- He eats.
- Medication disappears, we think he's taking it. (Vitamin D, fluoxetine).
- Heard it him crying once. But no wailing.
- Every time he's about to try and do something he grooms himself.

Questions:

- Why does he not leave the house? We should give him a hoodie, beanie or hat to deal with the hair.

He had a plan for his 18th birthday to catch a train to Brisbane to the unit. He could not bring himself to.

It feels "stable" at the moment, like we're in a holding pattern. He's in a comfort zone. At some point boredom might
make him push himself.

Belinda says we're doing the right thing, allowing things to stabilize.

Belinda says we could talk about what course we can get him into which would be the equivalent of completing 
year 12.

What are his goals now? We don't really know, he won't talk to us.
